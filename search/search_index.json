Interfaces \u00b6 The service has the following interfaces. Provided interfaces \u00b6 SWORDv2 \u00b6 Protocol type : HTTP Internal or external : external Purpose : depositing packages, submitting them for archival processing and tracking progress Deposit directories \u00b6 Protocol type : Shared filesystem Internal or external : internal Purpose : handing packages to the post-submission processing service and reporting back status changes written by that service to the deposit.properties files of the deposit directories Admin console \u00b6 Protocol type : HTTP Internal or external : internal Purpose : application monitoring and management Consumed interfaces \u00b6 The service consumes the following interfaces. Auth delegate \u00b6 Protocol type : HTTP Basic Auth Internal or external : internal Purpose : delegate authentication of a client for SWORD2 Authentication is discussed in more detail ot the User profiles & authentication page . Processing \u00b6 The following sections describe the interaction of a client with the SWORDv2 interface. The examples are curl commands. The meaning of the shell variables is as follows: Variable Meaning USER user name of sword client PASSWORD password of the sword client SWORD_BASE_URL the base URL of the SWORD service (the same URL is configured in config.yml as sword2.baseUrl ) SWORD_COL_IRI the URL of the collection that the deposit is sent to SWORD_EDIT_IRI the URL to send subsequent parts to in a continued deposit Getting the service document \u00b6 The service document is an XML document that lets the client discover the capabilities and the supported collections of the service. It can be retrieved with a simple GET request: curl -X GET -u $USER:$PASSWORD $SWORD_BASE_URL/servicedocument Pretty printing XML Use xmllint to display XML output in a more readable format (the final dash is intentional!): curl -X GET -u $USER:$PASSWORD $SWORD_BASE_URL/servicedocument | xmllint --format - Creating and submitting a deposit \u00b6 A deposit is created by binary file deposit . The other options that SWORDv2 specifies are currently not supported. Furthermore, the only packaging that is supported is http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt . This means that: the payload of the upload must be a ZIP file containing a bag ; the Packaging header must be set to http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt . It is furthermore mandatory to send along the Content-MD5 header. (Note that SWORD2 requires the content of this header to be a hex encoded MD5 digest, rather than the base64 encoded MD5 digest specified in RFC1864 about Content-MD5.) If bag.zip is such a ZIP file, then it can be uploaded as follows: export BAG=bag.zip curl -X POST \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/zip' \\ -H 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=bag.zip' \\ -H \"Content-MD5: $(md5 -q $BAG)\" \\ -H 'Packaging: http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt' \\ --data-binary @$BAG -u $USER:$PASSWORD $SWORD_COL_IRI (The md5 command used above is the one from BSD and MacOS. You may have to get the correct output in a different way on other systems. On Linux you can use $(md5sum $BAG | cut -d ' ' -f) .) If the upload is successful, the client will receive a deposit receipt . This is an Atom Entry document that contains, among other things, the statement URL (Stat-IRI), which is the URL the client can use to track post-submision processing . Continued deposit \u00b6 If the bag to be uploaded is larger than 1G it is recommended to use a continued deposit . The client must split the ZIP file into chunks and send these in separate requests with the In-Progress header set to true for all chunks except the last. The names of the chunk files must be: the name of the complete ZIP file, extended with .n , where n is the sequence number. (1) The first chunk is sent to the collection URL ( Col-IRI in SWORD terms), (2) the subsequent chunks are sent to the SWORD \"edit\" URL ( SE-IRI ), which can be found in the deposit receipt of the first upload. The client indicates that it will be sending more chunks by including the header In-Progress: true . Since the content of each separate chunk is not a valid ZIP file, the Content-Type must be set to application/octet-stream (which is a fancy way of saying the content consists of bytes). If bag.zip.1 , bag.zip.2 and bag.zip.3 are the chunks created by splitting bag.zip , they can be uploaded as follows: Step (1) export BAG=bag.zip curl -X POST \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \\ -H 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=bag.zip.1' \\ -H 'In-Progress: true' \\ -H \"Content-MD5: $(md5 -q ${BAG}.1)\" \\ -H 'Packaging: http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt' \\ --data-binary @${BAG}.1 -u $USER:$PASSWORD $SWORD_COL_IRI If the upload is successful the server will respond with a download receipt: <entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <generator uri=\"http://www.swordapp.org/\" version=\"2.0\"/> <id>https://swordserver.org/sword2/container/a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4</id> <link href=\"https://swordserver.org/sword2/container/a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4\" rel=\"edit\"/> <link href=\"https://swordserver.org/sword2/container/a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4\" rel=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/add\"/> <link href=\"https://swordserver.org/sword2/media/a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4\" rel=\"edit-media\"/> <packaging xmlns=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/\">http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt</packaging> <link href=\"https://swordserver.org/sword2/statement/a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4\" rel=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/statement\" type=\"application/atom+xml; type=feed\"/> <treatment xmlns=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/\">[1] unpacking [2] verifying integrity [3] storing persistently</treatment> <verboseDescription xmlns=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/\">received successfully: bag.zip.1; MD5: 494dd614e36edf5c929403ed7625b157</verboseDescription> </entry> Step (2) Parts 2 and 3 sent to the SWORD \"edit\" URL ( SE-IRI ). It can be retrieved from the deposit receipt by finding the link element with rel=\"edit\" . In the example this is https://swordserver.org/sword2/container/a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4 . curl -X POST \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \\ -H 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=bag.zip.2' \\ -H 'In-Progress: true' \\ -H \"Content-MD5: $(md5 -q ${BAG}.2)\" \\ -H 'Packaging: http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt' \\ --data-binary @${BAG}.2 -u $USER:$PASSWORD $SWORD_EDIT_IRI For the last part the In-Progress header is set to false. curl -X POST \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \\ -H 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=bag.zip.3' \\ -H 'In-Progress: false' \\ -H \"Content-MD5: $(md5 -q ${BAG}.3)\" \\ -H 'Packaging: http://purl.org/net/sword/package/BagIt' \\ --data-binary @${BAG}.3 -u $USER:$PASSWORD $SWORD_EDIT_IRI After this, the client will have to wait for the server to process the deposit. It should track the progress until the the server has confirmed that the deposit was fully processed. Finalizing a deposit \u00b6 When the client sends (the first part of) a bag, the server creates a draft deposit directory . As long as the client is uploading parts of the deposit, the state of the deposit directory is DRAFT . When the last part has been received, the state becomes UPLOADED . An \"uploaded\" deposit is waiting for finalization. When a finalization worker becomes available it will: change the state of the deposit to FINALIZING ; concatenate the parts uploaded in a continued deposit into one file in the order indicated by the sequences numbers at the endings of the file names (in a simple deposit this is skipped, of course); unzip the file (if this fails, the deposit becomes INVALID ); validate that resulting directory complies with the BagIt specs (if this fails, the deposit becomes INVALID ); change the state to SUBMITTED ; move the deposit to the directory configured for the collection in sword2.collections.<collection>.deposits . (See config.yml .) (Any error other than the upload not being a valid ZIP file or not being a valid bag, will cause the deposit to transition to a FAILED state. In other words, INVALID indicates faulty input by the client, FAILED means that the server was misconfigured or was experiencing other problems.) After this dd-sword2 , will not write to the deposit in any way . In other words, by moving the deposit tot he deposits directory dd-sword2 hands over further processing to a post-submission process. The only thing that dd-sword2 will continue to do is to serve the client the SWORD Statement whenever requested. This ensures the client can keep track of the deposit even after dd-sword2 is finished with it. Tracking post-submission processing \u00b6 As soon as the deposit exists, the client can track its state by downloading the SWORD statement from the Statement URL ( Stat-IRI ). This URL can be found in the deposit receipt in the link with the attribute rel=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/statement\" . A SWORD Statement is an Atom Feed document (the RDF/XML serialization is currently not supported by dd-sword2 ), for example: <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <id>$SWORD_STAT_IRI</id> <link href=\"$SWORD_STAT_IRI\" rel=\"self\"/> <title type=\"text\">Deposit a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4</title> <author> <name>user</name> </author> <updated>2019-05-23T14:51:15.356Z</updated> <category term=\"ARCHIVED\" scheme=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/terms/state\" label=\"State\"/> <entry> <content type=\"multipart/related\" src=\"urn:uuid:a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4\"/> <id>urn:uuid:a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4</id> <title type=\"text\">Resource urn:uuid:a5bb644a-78a3-47ae-907a-0bdf162a0cd4</title> <summary type=\"text\">Resource Part</summary> <updated>2019-05-23T14:51:22.342Z</updated> <link href=\"https://doi.org/10.5072/dans-Lwgy-zrn-jfyy\" rel=\"self\"/> </entry> </feed> The statement provides information about the deposit as it is processed by the server ( dd-sword2 and any post-submission process), most importantly the current state of the deposit.

The table below lists the states implemented by dd-sword2 and their meaning.

The description will detail what part of the bag is not according to specifications. The depositor is asked to fix the bag and resubmit the deposit.

A user can be configured with a profile that determines this behavior. It is also possible to configure a default profile that is used for users that do not have a profile of their own. The way a user account is authenticated is determined by its profile and the default profile together. Authentication is explained in more detail below. For the other profile settings, see the comments in the default configuration file . Configuring authentication \u00b6 The dd-sword2 service can be configured to authenticate users in the following ways: Basic authentication (username/password) against a password hash specified in the user's profile. The hash must be calculated with the BCrypt algorithm . In the example below the user's password is simply \"user001\": userProfiles: users: - name: user001 passwordHash: '$2a$10$yvmSYczU7z4KL6qmRCTgTeSvo7uurwPUbB9s/mTKzJrYM/sQKgF.y' collections: - collection1 filepathMapping: true Delegating authentication to a remote service, by forwarding specific headers to that service. This is used for users that are not in aforementioned list, or are in the list but without the passwordHash key. The remote service is configured in the default profile. In the example below the headers Authorization and X-Dataverse-key are forwarded to the remote service. userProfiles: default: passwordDelegate: url: 'http://localhost:20340/' forwardHeaders: - Authorization - X-Dataverse-key collections: - collection1 filepathMapping: true Some example scenarios: \u00b6 Scenario How to configure Only users with a profile can deposit data. Configure the users in userProfiles.users with a passwordHash and leave out userProfiles.default.passwordDelegate or set it to null All users can deposit data and share a single profile Configure the userProfiles.default section and include passwordDelegate to the system that authenticates the users; leave userProfiles.users null or empty All users can deposit data, some users need different settings Configure the userProfiles.default section and include passwordDelegate to the system that authenticates the users; configure the other users in userProfiles.users with their own settings Authentication process \u00b6 The dd-sword2 service uses the following process to authenticate a user: If basic authentication credentials are found in the request: If the username in the credential corresponds with a profile that has a passwordHash , validate the password againt the hash. Otherwise: If a default profile with a passwordDelegate is configured: delegate authentication to the remote service. Return a 401 Unauthorized response. If no basic authentication credentials are found in the request: If a default profile with a passwordDelegate is configured: delegate authentication to the remote service. Return a 401 Unauthorized response. Delegation protocol \u00b6 The dd-sword2 service delegates authentication to a remote service by forwarding the configured headers to that service, if found in the original request, by means of a POST request without a body. The remote service is expected to return a 200 OK with a body that contains the user's name in a simple json file, for example: { \"userId\": \"user001\" } If the credentials are not valid, the remote service is expected to return a 401 Unauthorized . An example implementation of such a remote service can be found in the dd-dataverse-authenticator project.
